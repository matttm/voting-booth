Voting Booth

This project is a voting booth simulator consisting of three parts:
- the frontend
- the backend
- the blockchain

The frontend, of course, will be the interface for registered voters to vote in a given state. A registered voter will be stored in a database i the backend, whereas the blockchain will store the registered voters votes.
